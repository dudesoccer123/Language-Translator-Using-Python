# Language-Translator-Using-Python

English may not always be the most popular language in the world. As the world continues to grow, other languages are gaining importance. Communication and travel are advancing rapidly, and geography is no longer a barrier when it comes to conducting business or any other international activities. The only remaining challenge is the language barrier.

To address this issue, our team has developed a Python program for a universal language translator. This tool helps individuals connect with people from around the world, share ideas, and communicate effectively.

The program utilizes the 'googletrans' library to translate text input into a wide range of languages (107 options available). The translated results are displayed in an interactive user interface, making it user-friendly. Additionally, all translations are saved in a unique CSV file created for each user, and this translation history can be accessed through the 'history' option.

The user interface is implemented using the tkinter library in python.

User accounts are managed through a MySQL database, ensuring secure and validated logins to maintain data integrity. The 'account settings' section allows users to update their account details, including passwords and usernames. All account-related functions, such as creation, deletion, and updating, are implemented using various SQL queries, with the MySQL connector module seamlessly connecting the database to our Python project.

Please find attached images showcasing different pages within the project and a data dictionary pdf containing all the user defined functions and its use.
